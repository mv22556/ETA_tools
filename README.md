# ETA_tools

ETA (Enhanced Terrain Analysis) Tools is an ArcToolbox for ArcMap developed primarily for raster processing. They expand and/or simplify the capabilities of ArcMap with an aim toward creating an easy-to-use user experience.

# Requirements

An ArcMap licene is required. As the tools are focused on raster processing, many of them require a Spatial Analyst license. Finally, there are two scripts/tools that use features found in versions 10.4 and greater.
